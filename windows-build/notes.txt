The main build is VS2008 since v3.7.
Before that it was VC6 sice v3.3.
Before that it was BCC.
The BCC build is still much used for development.
The MinGW build is experimental and will certainly not compile 
(did work at some point, but stopped following it).
There's a x64 build since v3.8.2 (VS2008 or VS2015). It uses C for drawing
instead of assembly.
