Script files to compile Steem SSE with MinGW (yes sir!)

The SET variables need to be edited according to your system
(build_mingw_set.bat).

build_mingw_asm.bat must be called first if asm files haven't been assembled 
yet.

build_mingw_debug.bat will build the boiler.

build_mingw_user.bat will build regular Steem SSE.
