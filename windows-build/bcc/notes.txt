Script files to compile Steem SSE with Borland C++ 5.5.
This was Steem's original compiler and it's still used for 
development builds.

The SET variables need to be edited according to your system 
(build_bcc_set.bat).

build_bcc_asm.bat must be called first if asm files haven't been assembled 
yet (uncomment the line).

build_debug_DD.bat will build Steem SSE Debugger.

build_user_DD.bat will build regular Steem SSE.

Those scripts use makefil3.txt.

Advantages of BCC:
Alternative compiler can see different problems
Very fast rebuild

Disadvantages of BCC:
No Windows 2000+ features
Less optimized
