A Unix (gcc) version of Steem SSE was also maintained, with fewer features
than the Windows versions, last version released was v3.7.2.

Steem SSE uses makefiles with txt extension, because of the way some
backup tools work.

Main build is made using "Makefile.txt"
To build XSteem SSE, enter this in the terminal:
 make -B -fMakefile.txt 3rdparty
 make -B -fMakefile.txt

Other builds
Makefile_dbg.txt: a debug build that may output some TRACE and info
about shifter tricks. This is NOT the famous Steem Boiler.
Makefile_dbg.txt is outdated for the moment.

Makefile_modules.txt: this was the original way to build Steem, with
fewer object files, using #include "xxx.cpp" instead. This should
still work but with fewer features.

Makefile_modules_SDL.txt: not working yet

The 2 step process was already the way for previous Steem versions.
It is justified by slow building of some 3rd party software.

You don't need administrative rights to compile.

But if you get compilation errors, you should update your configuration 
based on hints given by the compiler.
