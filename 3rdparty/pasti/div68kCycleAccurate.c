/*

 The routines below take dividend and divisor as parameters.
 They return 0 if division by zero, or exact number of cycles otherwise.

 The number of cycles returned assumes a register operand.
 Effective address time must be added if memory operand.

 For 68000 only (not 68010, 68012, 68020, etc).
 Probably valid for 68008 after adding the extra prefetch cycle.


 Best and worst cases for register operand:
 (Note the difference with the documented range.)


 DIVU:

 Overflow (always): 10 cycles.
 Worst case: 136 cycles.
 Best case: 76 cycles.


 DIVS:

 Absolute overflow: 16-18 cycles.
 Signed overflow is not detected prematurely.

 Worst case: 156 cycles.
 Best case without signed overflow: 122 cycles.
 Best case with signed overflow: 120 cycles
