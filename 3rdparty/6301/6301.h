DOMAIN: Emu
FILE: 6301.c
DESCRIPTION: Declarations to interface Steem SSE with a modified version of
sim68xx (Copyright (c) 1994-1996 Arne Riiber) to emulate at a lower level
the HD6301V1 chip that was in the ST, as described in 'HD6301V1 on ST.txt'.
This emulation was supposed to run as terminal on a DOS PC. A precise
integration with another serial device (MC6850 ACIA in the ST) wasn't the 
focus.
The functions in original files have been modified where necessary, some
have been added, in 6301.c, and in ireg.c (most interesting ones). 
This is C, not C++. 6301.c includes other C files.
All functions and variables beginning with hd6301 are declared in this
6301 module and are meant to be visible to Steem (interface) by way of
inclusion of this file.
