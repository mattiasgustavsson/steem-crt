AMIGA INSTALL NOTES

Put the "capsimage.device" in your DEVS: directory.

Please note: There are also some special things we want to do with the Amiga
port that are not fully implemented yet.


LINUX INSTALL NOTES

Copy the library to /usr/lib (or any other library search path):
# cp libcapsimage.so.4.2 /usr/lib/

Run ldconfig, which also creates the required symbolic links:
# ldconfig

Or you can do this manually by typing:
# ln -s /usr/lib/libcapsimage.so.4.2 /usr/lib/libcapsimage.so.4


MAC OS X INSTALL NOTES

Copy the CAPSImage.framework to /Library/Frameworks

You may alternatively install it in <Your home directory>/Library/Frameworks
if your access privileges are not high enough.
