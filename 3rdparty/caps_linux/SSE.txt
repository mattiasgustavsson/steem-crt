CAPS/SPS in Linux - Steem SSE notes

- Added txt extensions to history, license, readme, it helps my backup tool.

- There's no 'CapsPlug' for the Linux version. The functions of the library
  are defined in the library.
  But we use it anyway so the Windows/Linux differences appear in only one
  place. We have an extra step just like in Windows.

- For CTR/IPF disk image support, xsteem needs a library, libcapsimage.so.5.1

- To create the library, go into capsimg_source_linux_macosx/CAPSImg, type:
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

  Or use the one in the download.
  In any case, a libcapsimage.so.5 file is expected. Unlike the Windows version,
  we can't do without. 

- This should be placed in a shared library directory (usr/lib/...) and renamed
  libcapsimage.so.5, or an alias (symbolic link) should be created.

  Open a terminal in the library folder and type:

  sudo mv libcapsimage.so.5.1 libcapsimage.so.5

  or:

  sudo ln -s libcapsimage.so.5.1 libcapsimage.so.5


- To build xsteem with GCC, the library or its alias must be called libcapsimage.so
  (without 5!) - or there's something else I don't understand...

- Some files in capsimg_source_linux_macosx are referenced by Steem, they make up
  v5.1 of the library, files out of that folder are v4.2 and are not used.
