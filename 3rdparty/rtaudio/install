RtAudio - a set of C++ classes which provide a common API for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native ALSA, JACK, and OSS), Macintosh OS X (CoreAudio and JACK), and Windows (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems.

To configure and compile (on Unix systems and MinGW):

1. Unpack the RtAudio distribution (tar -xzf rtaudio-x.x.tar.gz).
2. From within the directory containing this file, run configure:

   ./configure

3. From within the "tests" directory, type "make".

A few options can be passed to configure, including:

  --enable-debug = enable various debug output
  --with-alsa = choose native ALSA API support (linux only)
  --with-oss = choose OSS API support (linux only)
  --with-jack = choose JACK server support (linux or Macintosh OS-X)
  --with-core = choose CoreAudio API support (Macintosh OS-X only)
  --with-asio = choose ASIO API support (windows only)
  --with-ds = choose DirectSound API support (windows only)

Typing "./configure --help" will display all the available options.  Note that you can provide more than one "--with-" flag to the configure script to enable multiple API support.

If you wish to use a different compiler than that selected by configure, specify that compiler in the command line (ex. to use CC):

  ./configure CXX=CC

For Windows Users:

RtAudio compiles with the MinGW compiler, though there appears to be a problem with ASIO support using gcc 4.4 (the compile is fine but with my RME HDSP 9632 driver, the functions to set and query the supported sample rates do not work).

Visual C++ 6.0 project files are included for the test programs in the /tests/Windows/ directory.  These projects compile API support for both ASIO and DirectSound.  Version 4.0 of RtAudio was tested with the .net compiler and it will not compile in Visual C++ 6.0 because of its non-conformance to modern C++ standards.
