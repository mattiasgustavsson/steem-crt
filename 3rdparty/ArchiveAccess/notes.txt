7z support in Steem using ArchiveAccess

1) Little config edit to have projects (DLL, ArchiveAccessTest) compiling 
   in VS2008 
2) Minimal mod to have ArchiveAccessTest compiling in BCC
3) Base interface for Steem on ArchiveAccessTest, we call this
   ArchiveAccessSSE, it stays in '3rd party'
4) We can compile the DLL itself in VS2008.
   It has been fixed so that it also works with BZ2 files.
   (ArchiveAccessClass.cpp line 645)
   So we'll include the DLL in the main download. It's rather elusive
   anyway.
5) Support for ArchiveAccess.dll compiles OK with VC6, VC9, BCC
