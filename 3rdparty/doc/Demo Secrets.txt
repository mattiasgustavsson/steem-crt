Demo Secrets


Not so secret anymore


                                 Version 1.02


        Before you continue to search for the hidden screens of your 
        favourite demos please note that some of the keys given here, 
        need to be replaced since some of the information was retrieved 
        from the French disk magazine "Toxic" and as you might know 
        French keyboards have a very odd layout. Most information in 
        this collection has been found in Toxic Mag and Disk Maggie, the 
        rest is my own discovery :).

        Thanks for helping with translating the information from French 
        to English have to go to C-Rem/MJJ Prod, Cooper/Paradize and ST 
        Survivor. Hidden screens:
