BUILDING

The included Makefile makes the executable "devel".  The file
devel.cpp is an example of using the filtering class.  The
documentation for the class is in filt.h, and the class itself is
implemented in filt.cpp.

TESTING and USAGE

The file cut.wav is about 8 seconds of an advertisement.  The file
cut.raw is the same 8 seconds with the 44 byte wav header removed.
The program devel.cpp is hard coded to filter the file cut.raw.  The
filtered output ends up in a file filtered.raw.

If you want to hear the results of the filtering, you need to add a
wav header to filtered.raw.  I use the freeware program "sox" to do
this (the sampling rate is 44.1Khz, there is 1 channel, and the data
is in a signed integer 16 bit format).  

As a shortcut, if you are in a Unix/Linux environment you can just use
the command

   cat hdr.dat filtered.raw > filtered.wav
