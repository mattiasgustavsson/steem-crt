Description=This patch applies to the Automation version of this game, there are other versions that work without a patch. This game doesn't work on a real STE, although it used to on Steem due to inaccurate emulation. Anyway, the emulation has improved to a point where this game freezes up (yay), so you need this patch to be able to play it.
ApplyWhen=It freezes up.
Version=Works on Steem v3.2
