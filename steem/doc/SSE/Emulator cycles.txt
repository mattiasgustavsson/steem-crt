Emulator cycles
=================

Emulator cycles are a reckoning common to Steem and Hatari that is handy
to reference Shifter tricks.

For example "switching the frequency to 60hz at cycle 376 removes the right
border of a 50hz line".

They are also called "line cycles" because they're reset for each scanline.

There's a simple relation between emulator cycles and 'position' in Alien's 
articles:

Emulator cycles = position * 4

Telling what "cycle 0" precisely means isn't so easy! 

Notice that in his article Alien said that he did not determine the exact 
moment the HBL interrupt takes place, and therefore a constant should be added 
to his numbers. Similarly, for the timing of HSYNC.

Here is an attempt at making the link between emulator cycles and GLUE events
 on the STF, based on "Atari Monitor Summary Specifications" by Shiraz Shivji,
May 14, 1986.
Graphics are for 60hz (US standard).
Absolute precision isn't claimed (off by 4?), we 



Notice that we consider a Shifter latency of 28 cycles (16 prefetch and 12 
"other") between 'Display Enable' (DE) and actual display of the pixel.

504     End of HSYNC            508     End of HSYNC


Strangely, the HBLANK interrupt (HBI) is triggered by the system (GLUE) only
after the HSYNC signal has been sent. Because of the time needed by
the system (MC68000 + MC68901) to process the interrupt itself, 56 cycles,
the interrupt code starts executing when the cathode ray is in the left 
border. This makes the HBI almost useless for anything related to display.
One wonders why it doesn't start at the start of HBLANK instead, 48
cycles earlier.




The Monitor Specification for vertical timing may also help us to locate
emulator cycles of the VBI.
Before the VBI, the video counter is reloaded with the base value. We know
that because some programs depend on this behaviour.
The time between those 2 events, about 1544 cycles, is equivalent to the
0.19 ms timing given in the graphic as VSYNC duration. So apparently
the video counter is reloaded just before VSYNC and the VBI is set pending
just after.

The indicated cycles are relative to the HBI = cycle 0 reference.

The VBI is set pending by the GLUE 64 cycles after the last HBI on a
STF, 68 on a STE.
