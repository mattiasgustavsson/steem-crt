Using svn command-line
=======================

It's not a manual, just some help on commands likely to be used.
'FreeCommander' makes using the command-line easier.


URL: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk/steemsse
Repository Root: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code
Repository UUID: dd3fbd3b-ef5d-4b78-98e8-da144fa02e5b

Commands
=========

svn import https://steven-seagal@svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk/ -m "Initial commit"
To import for the first time.
It asks for password, then user name then password again.

svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk steemsse-code
To download current source

svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk steemsse-code
To download current source and be able to commit

svn checkout -r 2 https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk steemsse-code
To specify which version we want

svn switch --relocate http://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk
If you downloaded with http and want to commit

svn update
To refresh local based on repository
Always start with this command or "svn info" will be outdated

svn info
To get address and current revision

svn add
To add a file

svn delete
To delete a file (use this, not OS)

svn status
To list files that were changed

svn diff >diff.txt
To create a file showing all changes

svn diff -r 16:27 >diff.txt
To show changes between revisions 16 and 27 (powerful!)

svn revert
To restore a file as it is in the repository

svn commit -m "the message"
svn commit -F file.txt
To upload changes

svn copy https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/tags/V3.4.0 -m "tag release 3.4.0"
To create a tag (release point)

$ svn copy https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/branches/STWdev -m "create branch for STW development"
To create a branch (development copy)

svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/branches/STWdev
To check out the branch if you will

svn switch --relocate https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/branches/STWdev
svn switch --relocate https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/branches/STWdev http://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk
to select where you will upload (1st line: in dev branch, 2nd line: in main trunk)

svn switch https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/branches/STWdev
svn switch https://svn.code.sf.net/p/steemsse/code/trunk
even simpler way, apparently recommended, lot of "delete/add" though
