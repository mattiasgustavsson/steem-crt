Plus some of mine

Japtro
------
-reset skips some parts
-hard to get it run on real STs though, the disks often do not run...
-released at Saturne party II
-I was puzzled to find out that it even worked "a little bit" on an emulator.
 This thing worked flawlessly on Elric's machine and mine, but after releasing
 it we saw that it didn't work on a lot of real STs.
BTW you get a small starfield screen when booting disk 2, 3 or 4 
(each one with a different music).

The french samples are from "Laspales & Chevallier" but I don't remember exactly 
what they said.

 The sample at the end of the "Keops & Severine" cartoon is from Steve Vai's 
"Sex & Religion" album.

 The fullscreen pics in the intro (that are completely skipped on some STs)
 are originally from a Cat's Eye / City Hunter art-book, and drawing them 
with Degas Elite, multiple palettes - and no mouse! - was a major pain in
 the butt.
