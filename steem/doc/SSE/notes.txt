- Documentation written or put together for Steem SSE emulator.
The difference with the 'doc' folder in '3rdparty' is that files are edited.
But they do contain 3rdparty documentation, sometimes copied and pasted, and
credit isn't given all the time.
To be honest some files probably should be deleted, they're not up-to-date,
for instance for microcodes.
