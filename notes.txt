Steem SSE project

Folders steem, 3rdparty, include, windows-build & X-build are part of Steem
source.
3rd party and include could be used by other projects.

steem/Steem.new.bak was the original Steem.new file. Its modified content
is now part of compiled resources (steem/rc/steem_new.txt).

A steem/code/SSE folder has been created for some extra code of Steem SSE 
since v3.4. In v4.0, files were moved to the /steem root and merged 
with other files of /code. 
cpp files in /steem and /include are translation units.
/steem/code/draw_c/draw_c.cpp is a translation unit, other files of this folder
are included.
For instance, /steem/cpu.cpp regroups the former steem/code/cpu_sse.cpp
and steem/code/SSE/SSECpu.cpp. cpu.cpp includes steem/code/cpu_ea.cpp and
steem/code/cpuinit.cpp.
The files in steem/code and steem/code/SSE are now empty.
A steem/headers/ folder was created to regroup all header files that were
before in steem/code and steem/code/SSE.
/3rdparty and /include still contain other headers.

In /3rdparty/6301, only 6301.c is a translation unit, other files are included.
In /3rdparty/ArchiveAccess/ArchiveAccess, only ArchiveAccessSSE is compiled for Steem SSE.
/3rdparty/avi/AviFile.cpp is compiled only in the DirectDraw builds.
In /3rdparty/caps, only CapsPlug.cpp is compiled for Steem SSE.
Both cpp files in /3rdparty/dsp are compiled.
/3rdparty/pasti/div68kCycleAccurate.c is compiled.

A steem/doc/SSE folder has been created for some extra documentation. There's no guarantee that it's up-to-date.
